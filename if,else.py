#AND, OR statement examples

#a = 55
#b = 58
#c = 66

#if a > b and c > a:
 #   print("a is greather than b and c")
#else:
  #  print("b and c are greater than a")

#else:

#IS statement used to evaluate if the IDs are equal or not

#a = [1,2,3,4]
#b = [1,2,3,4]
#if we print(a is b) it will be false because the id of these two numbers is different, to know the id print.
#print(id(a))
#print(id(b))
#and then you will see the difference in the terminal

#if you don't want to run the code do this for example
#a = 2
#b = 4
#if a < b:
    #pass
#and it will not run anything although you'll not see any error
